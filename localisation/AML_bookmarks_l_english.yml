 MUU_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Choosing not to participate in the Great War, Mu's economy was unable to profit fully from war. Significant portions of the population still live in rural areas, not able to access the wonders of the modern world.\n\nMu is in desperate need of revitalization. Recently a large scale dam project was started in southern Imiju state, but early indications show that the hoped for prosperity is unlikely to materialize."
 ATL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Atlantis saw the folly of the Great War and wisely stayed out, but her businesses and manufactories profited greatly from selling war materiel to both sides in the conflict. The Atlantean Navy continues to ensure the safety and security of the nation. Unfortunately the nation, however, is suffering.\n\nInternal tensions are coming to a head in Atlantis, with secret factions vying for control of the government and the hearts of the people. If Atlantis is to survive these next few years some compromises may be required to stabilize the internal situation before it becomes too late."
 TOD_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Despite Todorovia's voluntary participation in the Great War the nation is no better off than before. The rebellious colonies, who owe their supposed 'independence' to Todorovia, mock and reject Todorovia's rightful overlordship.\n\nTodorovia has the opportunity to decide the future; glory and honor, or safety. Will Todorovia gather her strength and bring back her lost sheep?"
 FMU_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Ripped from their German brethren at the end of the Great War, the Freistaaten Von Mu is a nation searching for purpose anew. It’s economy, based on agriculture and trade, took a big hit during the depression; now, the wealthy european upper class struggles to keep afloat the mines, ports, and plantations of the nation.\n\nAs nations around the world arm up, the FMU must decide if it wants to uphold its colonial legacy, or make a new name for itself as a local superpower. It remains a major player around the Austral Ocean and south Mu, but for how long, only time will tell..."
 KUM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The conflict between the capitalists and the traditionalists of the nation has reached a boiling point, fueled by the continent-wide famine. Longstanding tensions between the factions has created a situation where the nation is ripe for open sectarian conflict, and the people starve without government aid. The time has come for the people of Kumari to decide whether they will reclaim their former glory, or if they will forge a new path into the future."
 MKU_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Meru Kumari, like the remainder of the continent of Lemuria, had nothing to do with the Great War. Unfortunately, this also meant that the people of Meru Kumari were unable to profit from the conflict, nor were they in a position to benefit from the technological advances created by the war. Meru Kumari is now dealing with a major famine that has gripped the continent. Will they emerge from the famine as a stronger, more advanced nation? Or will they continue to be gripped by the apathy that has controlled them for so long?"
 KLK_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Kalari Kingdom, the oldest and most venerable of the Indolemurian Empires, tried to profit from the Great War but found that its lack of organized industry and the tenuous connections to its outlying provinces made difficult to bring in much business. The government has been cultivating the capitalist ethos to try to bring more industry and development to its people. \n One of Kalari's greatest problems is that its rural areas are ripe for the ravaging fires of revolution. A little know, but quite radical, young man in neighboring Lasnova has begun to garner a following and he has set his sights on Kalari. Only time will tell what will become of this movement that he leads."
 BLM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "If the Balkans is the Powderkeg of Europe, then British Lemuria is the Tonne of TNT of Lemuria. The dominion is riven with strife over English ethno-nationalist efforts to extinguish the identities of other immigrants. One group, the Anglish, are trying to hyper-emphasize their Anglo-Saxon identity, going so far as to ostracise their English neighbors as not being 'Anglish' enough. Unfortunately for British Lemuria, this has lead to extreme tensions in the nation which are liable to not only break into conflict, but drag the whole nation into a series of multi-sided civil wars which might result in the utter destruction of British Lemuria. Can British Lemuria survive the next few years intact?"
