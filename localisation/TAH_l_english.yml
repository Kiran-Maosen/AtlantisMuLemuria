 TTI_civil_war: "Fascist Tahiti"
 TAH_civil_war: "Socialist Republic of Tahiti"
 tahitian_civil_war:1 "The Tahitian Civil War has begun"
 tahiti.1.t:0 "Civil War!"
 tahiti.1.d:0 "Not content with poisoning our national discourse, the fascists have declared a military coup! The traitorous generals in the Armed Forces have raised their banner in rebellion and seek to strike down the duely elected, rightful government of Tahiti. Sadly a number of cities have joined with these traitors, dividing our nation at a time it can least afford such strife. \n\n Thankfully, leftist volunteers and the remainder of the military are flocking to the banners of the Communist government, ready to support it against the rebels. The volunteers may be poorly trained, but no one can question their enthusiasm.\n\nThe battle-lines have been drawn - which faction should we support?"
 tahiti.1.a:0 "The Nationalists!"
 tahiti.1.b:0 "The Communists!"
 tahiti.10.d:1 "The people of Tahiti have spoken and the nationalist agenda is what the people want. Our troops have moved to secure the major cities, but a portion of the military, lead by the Red Generals, has resisted our lawful orders. Leftist rabble have set up barricades in the streets and have begun fighting against us! \n\n This People's Army, lead by the traitorous Red Generals, has begun to organize and arm themselves. Despite these traitors fighting against us we shall destroy them on the field of battle, or send them to the firing squad. Once we have recaptured and pacified the country we will make sure that the Red Generals will be publicly tried, convicted, and executed.\n\nThe battle-lines have been drawn - which faction should we support?"
 tahiti.10.b:0 "The People's Army!"
 nationalists_chosen:0 "Death to the Communists!"
 republicans_chosen:0 "Death to the Fascists!"
 tahiti.2.t:0 "Seek International Support?"
 tahiti.2.d:0 "The coup has not been a complete success, but the fascists have convinced a significant portion of the military to rise up in rebellion against the pretender government. The outcome is still uncertain, with the world watching with concern which side will emerge victorious.\n\nWe did not execute this coup by standing idly by, however, and neither should the world if it wants to crush the Communist threat. Other nations in the same process of restoring their national glory should be willing to come to our aid."
 tahiti.2.a:0 "Let's request equipment and munitions."
 tahiti.2.b:0 "Tahiti must be won with Tahitian blood!"
 tahiti.3.d:0 "Reactionary and fascist forces in the military have sought to crush the Republic in one swift blow, but did not expect the resistance they met in major cities nor the rapid mobilization of workers' militias. Rather than a coup, they have started a war, war on progress and the future the Tahitian people wanted.\n\nDemocratic and socialist nations alike voice support for the Republic, but few dare commit to direct involvement. We could ask them to support our endeavor, or the oppressors will come for their liberty and solidarity next."
 tahiti.3.a:0 "This is an international struggle to contain fascism!"
 tahiti.3.b:0 "We will not become a puppet of degenerated workers' states!"
 tahiti.4.t:0 "Nationalist Tahiti Wants Our Help"
 tahiti.4.d:0 "The Tahitian Civil War has become a sort of microcosm for our view of the global situation: Communists and liberals seek to destroy old values, and we take up arms to revive them. It is not surprising that the Nationalists in Tahiti have reached out to us and others to equip them for the coming conflict."
 tahiti.4.a:0 "We promise to send what we can."
 tahiti.4.b:0 "If they lack the strength to seize power, they do not deserve it."
 tahiti.5.t:0 "Communist Tahiti Wants Our Help"
 tahiti.5.d:0 "The attempt to overthrow the Tahitian Republic is a clear signal that the fascists will not allow the flowers of progress to grow even where they naturally take root. The Communists and their allies, have turned to us and other parts of the international community for help. While the Communists may be in power now, they were duely elected by the people. Many nations who claim to defend democracy and liberty have withheld their support for fear of being dragged into the war. How do we respond?"
 tahiti.5.a:0 "Promise them to send arms and equipment."
 tahiti.4.a.tt:0 "[From.GetName] will be thankful if we arrange a lend-lease during the war."
 tahiti.5.b:0 "Sadly, we cannot afford to intervene."
 tahiti.6.t:0 "Nationalist Tahiti Appreciates our Help"
 tahiti.6.d:0 "Our lend-lease to Nationalist Tahiti has not gone unnoticed. Should they emerge victorious, we may find ourselves with a strong ally once Tahiti is rebuilt."
 tahiti.6.a:0 "Let us hope they contain the Red terror."
 tahiti.7.t:0 "Communist Tahiti Appreciates our Help"
 tahiti.7.d:0 "Our lend-lease to Communist Tahiti has not gone unnoticed. If the Republic is restored, we can trust they will support our continued efforts to rid the world of fascist scum."
 tahiti.7.a:0 "Long live the Republic!"
 tahiti.8.t:0 "The Capital Reclaimed"
 tahiti.8.d:0 "The war is won. The capital is ours again and we have opportunity to make the age old city the center of Tahiti once again. It has seen much battle and will require rebuilding. What better way to do this than making it our capital?"
 tahiti.8.a:0 "Move the capital"
 tahiti.8.b:0 "Keep current location"
 tahiti.9.t:0 "Tahitian Election of 1936"
 tahiti.9.d:0 "The Republic has proven to be a fragile existence. Manuel Azaña can be president with the backing of the Popular Front, a broad coalition of left-wing groups supported by republicans, communists and anarchists.\n\nBut the right-wing opposition, encompassing conservatives, monarchists and fascists, is also beginning to unite for the cause of bringing down the Popular Front. Whichever coalition falls apart, their opponents are likely to take advantage of their internal conflicts to launch a revolution. This election is not the final test Tahiti will have to endure to resolve this conflict."
 tahiti.9.a:0 "Maintain the Popular Front."
 tahiti.9.b:0 "Unite the conservative groups under Falange."
