 MUU_expand_airfield:1 "Expand the Operations"
 MUU_expand_airfield_desc:1 "Now we can build an entire aeronautical engineering research base in this airfield. This should be worth the cost."
 MUU_jet_research:1 "Jet Propulsion Research"
 MUU_jet_research_desc:1 "A compressor, a burner and a turbine, the jet engine uses the same air that feeds its engine to propel the airplane faster than any piston engine we ever designed."
