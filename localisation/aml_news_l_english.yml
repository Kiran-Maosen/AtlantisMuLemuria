With Osoa captured Germany's invasion of the island nation has become a very serious threat to the integrity of the Atlantean nation. \n\nAtlantis has now been split, and only time will tell the true victor in this conflict."

German media reports that Anoixte, and the remainder of the island of Sumendia, capitulated after the German troops secured both the harbor and the Atlantean artillery in the island's highlands. \n\nWith the capture of the island of Sumendia Atlantis no longer controls the Kolpo.
