 FMU_veto_native_rights_bill_desc:1 "The law ensures that the people in charge of the economic policies are the ones making the money"
 FMU_pass_native_rights_bill:1 "Pass Landowners' Suffrage Amendment"
 FMU_pass_native_rights_bill_desc:1 "The constituiton of the FMU dictates that only landowners are allowed suffrage, confining the range of voters to the upper class. An amendment to relax these laws and allow more people to vote has a been up in the air in the government for a long time. Passing this would give common citizens more rights and would let newer ideas help develop the nation."
 FMU_neutralplaceholder1:0 "Proven Values"
 FMU_neutralplaceholder1_desc:0 "We must not deviate from the policies and governance that our people expect from us. To do so would be a betrayal of our national ideals and identity. We must bring our people together, not divide them in these perilous times."
 FMU_neutralplaceholder2:0 "Force of Arms"
 FMU_neutralplaceholder2_desc:0 "The military has proven in the past to be an effective tool of the government. We must strengthen and refine our military to provide the government the best tools."

 FMU_unite_germans:0 "Unite the Mu-Deutsche"

 FMU_schoenesland_1:0 "Invite Schönland"
 FMU_schoenesland_1_desc: "When we first arrived on this rich continent, the German people had spread far and wide. The island nation of Schönland is one of those settlements. It is reasonable that they would see our goal as clearly as we do."
 FMU_schoenesland_2:0 "The Schönland Question"
 FMU_schoenesland_2_desc: "Though far removed from us geographically, Schönland is another bastion of German heritage. A century ago, we helped them secure their freedom. Today, we shall lead them to their glory again"
 FMU_vogelinsel_1:0 "Invite Vogelinsel"
 FMU_vogelinsel_1_desc:0 "A humble nation of South Mu, Vogelinsel had once voted to stay out of the Freiestaaten. Nonetheless, they remain a close neighbour, and see plenty of influence from the FMU. Perhaps they would be willing to step up our cooperation?"
 FMU_vogelinsel_2:0 "Ultimatum to Vogelinsel"
 FMU_vogelinsel_2_desc:0 "The nation of Vogelinsel is meager and vulnerable. Their independence had given them relative peace, but as war draws near, their chances of surviving dwindle. Joining the Freiestaaten is their only path to glory."
 FMU_challenge_austral_sea:0 "Austral Ocean Dominance"
 FMU_challenge_austral_sea_desc:0 "Many times in history nations have tried to claim bodies of water as their own. Most have not succeeded. But our dominance of the Austral Ocean is assured!"
 FMU_supress_manu_nationalism:1 "Oust Opposition in Manu"
 FMU_supress_manu_nationalism_desc:1 "The 1920 treaty of Brunpfadstad ended the brief British protectorate and reorganized Saxonia Austral as the Manu Autonomous State under FMU administration. Manu was to be admitted as a full state of the FMU by 1935; unfortunately, many fascist sympathizers in their government have resisted integration of the state. The only way we can move forward is by weeding out these obstructionists."
 FMU_rebuild_the_dockyards:1 "Rebuild the Dockyards"
 FMU_rebuild_the_dockyards_desc:1 "The heaviest toll in the Great War was taken by our southern ports. Housing a majority of our civilian and military dockyards, Blauwasser was a hub of trade and naval power for the growing FMU. Ruthless coastal bombardment and the occupation of the city by Entente forces left this industry in ruins. If we hope to revitalize the nation, it is best to start here."
 FMU_ripples_of_shanghai:1 "Ripples of Shanghai"
 FMU_ripples_of_shanghai_desc:1 "7 years ago, sparked by the sinking of its crown vessel in the ports of Shanghai, the economic bubble of the German South Mu Company popped, with catastrophic consequences. Once a major holder of all trade in and out of Mu, the company is now a husk of its former shelf, and the economic influence it gave us is slipping out of our hands."
 FMU_kohn_gambit:1 "Kohn Gambit"
 FMU_kohn_gambit_desc:1 "Thomas Kohn is a steadfast owner of the Kohn Produktionsfirma, the biggest individual exporter of goods in the nation. His investments in the GSMC helped sustain it, and even today he remains a staunch supporter of it. Perhaps, handing the company’s control over to a single more experienced entrepreneur like him will help revitalize it, and tie its exports directly with it."
 FMU_germans_over_all:1 "Deutsche Über Alles"
 FMU_germans_over_all_desc:1 "The Germanic race has no other it compares to. Surviving hardships far and wide, and fighting our way into glorious independence on this foreign and wild continent, we have proven ourselves superior. The lesser must understand to never challenge us."
 FMU_open_stocks:1 "Open Stocks"
 FMU_open_stocks_desc:1 "The GSMC's recession has can be largely attributed to our failures to keep up with the times. We can help revitalize the company by better spreading out leadership, and encouraging more investment in its stocks. Although the company would become heavily decentralized, it would promote investment, as well as gain us more stability should some investors choose to retract like they have before."
 FMU_annex_manu:1 "Integrate Manu"
 FMU_annex_manu_desc:1 "The integration of the Manu Autonomous State has been delayed far too long. Reluctant far-right administration as well as disagreement over the future of the nation have been a thorn in the FMU's side, hurting our politics and economy for the past decade. It's time to put down our foot and stomp out these fascist once and for all."
 FMU_kaiser_is_back:1 "The Kaiser is Back"
 FMU_kaiser_is_back_desc:1 "With the illegitimate regime gone, the Kaiser has taken his rightful place on the throne of Germany! Now that the fatherland is no longer under the iron hand of the fascists, perhaps our ties can grow stronger again."
 FMU_status_quo:1 "Status Quo"
 FMU_status_quo_desc:1 "Change attracts instability. Why crumble under the wave of modern discourse, when we already have all we need?"
 FMU_revoke_sanction:1 "Revoke The Sanctions"
 FMU_revoke_sanction_desc:1 "The Treaty of Versailles imposed a number of unfair sanctions on us. While our workers toil away, the French and British reap our profit. No Freistaater should bear to live like this; the time has come to stand up for ourselves and deny the imperialist powers their oppressive demands."
 FMU_reinstate_the_associate_state:1 "Restore the Associate State Status"
 FMU_reinstate_the_associate_state_desc:1 "The Associate State represented a golden era for the german people. Our economy prospered under the Kaiserreich, and offered us mutual military support. But it is not too late to reinstate the Associate State, and once again reunite with our european brethren."
 FMU_encourage_fascists:1 "Encourage Fascism"
 FMU_encourage_fascists_desc:1 "Fascism seems to have brought Germany strength and unity; perhaps it will work for us too. Many officials in the government have sympathies to Hitler's regime; we should hear them out."
 FMU_snap_elections:1 "Snap Elections"
 FMU_snap_elections_desc:1 "The support for the ZNSP has reached a critical high. The people's demands have been made clear. We should organize a snap election to hear the populace out; lest we risk a revolt."
 FMU_claims_on_tiquea:1 "Claims on Tiquea"
 FMU_claims_on_tiquea_desc:1 "Such barbarism! The Tiqueans don't know how to run their country, nor how to treat the natives that infest their lands. We must not only guide them, but force them, to act properly. "
 FMU_just_another_research_slot:1 "Freiestaater Research"
 FMU_just_another_research_slot_desc:1 "Our great universities produce some of the best research in the world but there are a lot of young, attractive distractions there. Now we have a perfect place to send researchers so that they do not get distracted - Antarctica! Our scientists can spend months at a time doing nothing but efficiently researching when there are no external distractions!"
 FMU_brotherhood:1 "Brotherhood"
 FMU_brotherhood_desc:1 "The brotherhood of the Mu-Deutsche peoples is undeniable. We come from the same blood and thus we obviously belong together!"
 FMU_seize_fijnland:0 "Seize Fijnland"
 FMU_seize_fijnland_desc:1 "It has become increasingly clear the Dutch are incapable of administering their colonies. We would be doing them a favour by taking nearby Fijnland off their hands."
 FMU_ban_japanese_immigration:1 "Ban Japanese Immigration"
 FMU_ban_japanese_immigration_desc:1 "Why should any non-German, let alone one from Japan, come into our country and take jobs from hardworking Mu-Deutsche people? No, we shall not allow them to come and dilute our ideals."
 FMU_join_allies:1 "Join Allies"
 FMU_join_allies_desc:1 "Only a blind fool would stand on the wrong side of history! As the world is taken by storm with radical ideologies, the Allies represent a promise of democratic freedom and stability. Joining them would protect us, and help us fight for a more liberal world!"
 FMU_nationalize_plantations:1 "Nationalize Plantations"
 FMU_nationalize_plantations_desc:1 "Too many privately owned plantations in this nation exploit their workers, then stash the profits in vast family vaults, only growing richer. The money of the hardworking Freistaater should help develop the nation! By forcing some of these plantations to pay more taxes and lend land to the government, we can mitigate this inequality."
 FMU_request_new_guinea:1 "Request Papua and New Guinea"
 FMU_request_new_guinea_desc:1 "After the Great War, the German Colony of Papua and New Guinea made its way into the hands of the Australian’s. As part of rightful German territory, we have the right to demand it back immediately. The colony could be a potential key asset in the Austral Sea, a first line of defense against both America and the Japanese."
 FMU_subsidize_colonial_companies:1 "Subsidize Colonial Companies"
 FMU_subsidize_colonial_companies_desc:1 "The German companies are becoming a significant player as we industrialize. The government should strive to support it’s nation’s big businesses."
 FMU_join_axis:1 "Join The Axis"
 FMU_join_axis_desc:1 "Despite being scattered all over the world, the German people will achieve victory through cooperation. It is our obligation to join the Third Reich’s cause, and help them both at home and abroad."
 FMU_antarctic_expedition:1 "Antarctic Expedition"
 FMU_antarctic_expedition_desc:1 "The southern continent has remained elusive. Cold conditions, relentless snowstorms, and lack of civilization means that no one has attempted to reach the south pole again since 1911. If we can claim the silver medal for this accomplishment with an even bolder expedition, we can be sure to receive admiration among the scientific community."
 FMU_centralize:1 "Centralize"
 FMU_centralize_desc:1 "As it stands now, our nation is divided; too many regulations differ between the states, and agreement is inconsistent. A strong nation needs a centralized government and an clear vision for the future. We must reform the government, and make sure everyone gets an equal treatment under the Freiestaaten law, from every Ottostaater to Wüstenlander."
 FMU_commonplaceholder2:1 "Preparing Alternate Naval Facilities"
 FMU_commonplaceholder2_desc:1 "The Great War proved that placing all of our primary naval facilities in one location was folly. We must prepare another group of dockyards to continue producing hulls, should a war turn for the worst. And we must protect our capital against naval invasion as well!"
 FMU_american_union:1 "A More American Union"
 FMU_american_union_desc:1 "The union system of the FMU is vague and unclear. While at its core, the Staats are established as distinct administrative entities, they in practice rarely find the power to make their own laws. The USA is wildly successful, in part because they had given all of their states equal speak in the nations future, and plenty of self-determination. We must model our system on this to improve."
 FMU_recognize_dutch:1 "Recognize Dutch"
 FMU_recognize_dutch_desc:1 "While the FMU has always been German at its core, it’s important we don’t forget our roots under the crown of the Netherlands. Many Freistaater have Dutch roots, and still speak the language at home. We should fully embrace our identity and recognize Dutch as a second official language."
 FMU_admit_gdea:1 "Admit The GdEA Into Parliament"
 1_FMU_tt:0 "GdEA becomes an official government party"
 FMU_admit_gdea_desc:1 "The Gesellschaft der Einheimischen Arbeiter has in recent years risen to prominance as a major political player. Pushing for native rights and a more socialist system, they have been a nuisance, but made strides in accomplishing their goal. Perhaps it’s time to face the music, and let the Native communists pursue their mission as an official political party."
 FMU_an_unexpected_change_of_plans:1 "A Change in Plans"
 FMU_an_unexpected_change_of_plans_desc:1 "With the GdEA's inclusion in political discourse there has been a sudden change in the national mood. People that were supposedly loyal party members elsewhere have begun flocking to the GdEA's political rallies. Perhaps we should pay more attention to this formerly blacklisted party."
 FMU_rewrite_constitution:1 "Rewrite the Constitution"
 FMU_rewrite_constitution_desc:1 "The rise of Communism as a defining force in our government has given us the opportunity, and the momentum, to make some sweeping changes to our constitution that are sorely needed. It may cause a bit of strife, but ultimately it will be best for the people."
 FMU_soviet_aid:1 "Soviet Aid"
 FMU_soviet_aid_desc:1 "Our people, or at least the more conservative elements, are resisting the necessary changes that we must make to help the people achieve greatness. We should enlist the help of our friends, the Soviets, to navigate these societal and governmental changes. We could also get their aid in streamlining and modernizing our industry!"
 FMU_nativisation:1 "Nativisation"
 FMU_nativisation_desc:1 "For too long have the conservatives of our government dictated policy blindly. Some of our ministers have come up with a brilliant plan to gut the power of these reactionaries - by giving the natives voting rights, and by acknowledging them as the original inhabitants of the land, we can not only empower a group of workers to join the Revolution, but it will enlist them to our side in the political fray."
 FMU_deepen_democracy:1 "Deepen Democracy"
 FMU_deepen_democracy_desc:1 "We must further deepen our commitment to the principles of democracy. Anything else would be a betrayal of our founding ideals and of our people!"
 FMU_negotiate_sanctions:1 "Negotiate The Sanctions"
 FMU_negotiate_sanctions_desc:1 "Nearly 20 years have passed since the end of the Great War, and the FMU has been a model nation. Despite the hard hit we took, we have continued to grow, and we have been on good terms with the British and French. We are in a good position to request renegotiation of the steep sanctions placed on us."
 FMU_claims_on_antarctica:1 "Claims On Antarctica"
 FMU_claims_on_antarctica_desc:1 "We have boldly gone where men weaker men have feared to go! The southern continent may be devoid of resources, but it is land nonetheless, to which we have a rightful claim! No reaches of the world are too dangerous for a Freistaater!"
 FMU_communist_hunt:1 "Hunt Down The Communists"
 FMU_communist_hunt_desc:1 "The claws of socialism have reached us too, and tug on our coatails like some demented monster. Deranged exiles from the homeland conspire with the rowdy and dangerous natives to bring the shadows of revolution to the FMU. As long as they stand, we cannot rest easy. No home will go unchecked anymore."
 FMU_maywerken:1 "Maywerken"
 FMU_maywerken_desc:1 "The experiences of Europe have taught us that transportation and communication are key factors in production. The Maywerken will be a major undertaking: a nationwide board of over 30 companies from different industries, subsidized by the government, with the purpose of simplifying deals, constructing new railways and roads, and regulating the production of goods all the way from raw material to the port."
 FMU_allied_research_bonus:1 "Joint Research"
 FMU_allied_research_bonus_desc:1 "Our good relations with the nations of the commonwealth could perhaps give us access to some of the top minds of the scientific and engineering community."
 FMU_military_companies:1 "Military Companies"
 FMU_military_companies_desc:1 "We can no longer ignore the looming threat of global war. Just as all the other great powers have, we must shift our economy to producing military gear. Only well armed can we survive the oncoming storm, and make a name for ourselves in history."
 FMU_civilian_companies:1 "Civilian Companies"
 FMU_civilian_companies_desc:1 "Our economy has always enjoyed the greatest boons from exporting raw materials and food products. The war is far away from us, so while the great powers clash, our economy can prosper on civilian goods." 
 FMU_military_buildup:1 "Military Buildup"
 FMU_military_buildup_desc:1 "The safety and security of our nation and people lie in the hands of our loyal military. By adding substantially to their numbers we shall secure our borders." 
 FMU_aggressive_strikes:1 "Bold Action"
 FMU_aggressive_strikes_desc:1 "Our generals are planning 'bold action.' By this we can only assume they mean to militarily correct some of the border irregularities that have always plagued our nation." 
 FMU_liberalplaceholder1:1 "Stirrings of Industry"
 FMU_liberalplaceholder1_desc:1 "Despite the social shock of the government passing the Landowners' Suffrage Amendment, our people have begun to warm to the idea. They have even begun to invest in factories, proving our government's prediction about the move right." 
 FMU_liberalplaceholder3:1 "Minority Confidence"
 FMU_liberalplaceholder3_desc:1 "Even now the Dutch speaking citizens who live primarily along our border with Fijnland have begun to invest in industry. How could we have ever doubted the wisdom of giving more people voting rights?" 
 FMU_accept_german_scientists:1 "Accept German Scientists"
 FMU_accept_german_scientists_desc:1 "Many brilliant minds from Germany are dismayed at the direction that Hitler has taken the country. We should offer them a safe, German home, with good schnitzel and even better beer." 
 FMU_democratic_0:1 "Infrastructure Growth"
 FMU_democratic_0_desc:1 "The Jaegerbergen divide the east from the west in FMU. We must ensure national unity by carving roads and railroads through the mountains to link our nation together." 
 FMU_democratic_1:1 "Industrial Growth"
 FMU_democratic_1_desc:1 "The newly enfranchised voters of FMU are now beginning to invest in industry. We must pave the way for them to not only vote, but to control and expand key industries." 
 FMU_democratic_2:1 "Niemals Hitler!"
 FMU_democratic_2_desc:1 "The rise of the Nazis in Germany, along with their radical ideas, have pushed many Germans into finally immigrating to FMU. Here, they feel that the government supports their ideals and beliefs."
 01_FMU_democratic2: "Immigrants swell the ranks of the military." 
 FMU_democratic_3:1 "Rebirth of Military Industry"
 FMU_democratic_3_desc:1 "We understand why our industry was destroyed during the Great War, but it still crippled our military for years. Now is the time to undo what was done and again build up our military; this time we fight on the side of Right."
 FMU_democratic_4:1 "Immigrant Capital"
 FMU_democratic_4_desc:1 "A few of the immigrants from Germany brought significant amounts of capital with them as they fled the Nazi regime. Most have begun investing in industries across the FMU."
 FMU_democratic_5:1 "War is Hell"
 FMU_democratic_5_desc:1 "The conflict in Europe, perpetrated by Nazi Germany, has brought another significant wave of immigration from the war-ravaged continent. We must welcome them with open arms, but remind them of their responsibilities to their new homeland."
 01_FMU_democratic5: "Another wave of immigrants join the ranks of the military." 
 FMU_democratic_6:1 "End of the Sanctions"
 FMU_democratic_6_desc:1 "After years of toil and diplomacy we have finally gained the chance to prove to the winners of the Great War that our contrition is true. If we publicly renounce all ideological ties to Germany, perhaps they will lift the sanctions imposed by the Treaty of Versailles."
 FMU_pacific_doctrine:1 "Pacific Doctrine"
 FMU_pacific_doctrine_desc:1 "Japan has had free reign in the Pacific for far too long. We must aid the forces of democracy in suppressing the Japanese Hydra at sea. Our naval yards must grow to further strengthen the FMU's navy."
 FMU_curb_fascism:1 "Curb Fascism"
 FMU_curb_fascism_desc:1 "Hitler is a devious monster! He sent Nazi propagandists and agitators with the last wave of immigrants. We must work dilligently to root them out!"
 FMU_military_start:1 "The FMU Armed Forces"
 FMU_military_start_desc:1 "The Great War has shown us that we are militarily unprepared for another major conflict. Restructuring and reforming our military will provide us the chance to remedy this deficiency."
 FMU_airwings:1 "Airwings"
 FMU_airwings_desc:1 "Organized aerial squadrons who train and drill together could provide significant advantages on the battlefield."
 FMU_army_reform:1 "Army Reform"
 FMU_army_reform_desc:1 "By instituting some structural changes in our army ranks we may be able to introduce more efficiency and allow the adoption of more advanced weapons and methods."
 FMU_bushland_troops:1 "Buschlandtruppen"
 FMU_bushland_troops_desc:1 "The interior of the FMU has proven to be a very tough training ground for our troops."
 FMU_heavy_warships:1 "Heavy Hulls"
 FMU_heavy_warships_desc:1 "Our military scientists would like permission to study the construction and hulls of foreign war vessels. They project a major improvement in our naval fighting capability if they are successful."

 FMU_nybornholm_question_desc:0 "We have long had much in common with our Nybornholmer Danish brethren. In fact, we feel that we have more in common with them than they possibly could with Denmark! We eat the same foods, we drink the same liquors, and we sleep under the same stars. Even the Danish they speak is now mostly German! They should become one with us and our glory!"
 fmu.1.t:0 "Liberale Koalition Wins Elections"
 fmu.1.d:0 "The 1936 election in the FMU have concluded with a suprising victory at the hands of the Liberale Koalition. A progressive group, the LK party has only gained traction within recent years, but it seems to have been enough to garner them a slim majority of the votes. The party is already promising to undertake major reforms of the nation, in hopes of revitalizing the economy, mending the nation's poor diplomatic relations, and creating a more democratic and egalitarian state."
 fmu.1.a:0 "To a new course for the Freiestaaten!!"
 fmu.2.t:0 "Selbstverwaltung Partei Wins Elections"
 fmu.2.d:0 "Despite the increased political resistance this term, the Selbstverwaltung Partei has emerged victorious once again. Dominating the nations politics since independence in 1919, the party upholds self-rule for the FMU, and favours an economy built on large, German-owned companies within the country. Although it has become a pillar of stability for the people, there are worries among the government that many members of the party have become unscrupulous in their rule, and foster authoritarian sympathies."
 fmu.2.a:0 "To another properous term!"
 fmu.3.t:0 "DMS-GdEA Merger Announced"
 fmu.3.d:0 "A mere days after becoming an officially functional party, the Gewerkschaft der Einheimischen Arbeiter, under the leadership of Sumukivi Aepa’ato, has announced it would be forming a coalition with the germanocentric Deutschemu Sozialisten. Although a predictable move, this change still caused quite an upheaval in the upper echelons of FMU's parlamient. The combined popularity of the two parties represents a communist bloc finally big enough to challenge the Selbstervaltung and LK parties."
 fmu.3.a:0 "Strength comes in numbers and cooperation."
 fmu.4.t:0 "FMU Requests Immediate Execution of Integration"
 fmu.4.d:0 "Since 1918, the FMU has held us under its sphere. The ruthless opportunists and backhand paperpushers they are, from that very day they seeked to draw us closer into their union. Plans were drafted, and a date was set for 1935. The NSSAP had played stall tactics, wrestling power out of the FMU temporary administration, and giving it back to the people. But it seems patience has run thin. After the recent purges in our government and replacement of key fascist politicians, they have issued a demand to push through the annexation immediately, and admit Manu as a full Staat of the FMU"  
 fmu.4.a:0 "We can't resist anymore."
 fmu.4.b:0 "Never shall Saxonia Austral stand under any flag but our own!"
 fmu.5.t:0 "Manu Accepts Integration"
 fmu.5.d:0 "It seems our recent interventions have indeed cleared up the mess that was Manu's administration. A simple message came in today to the parlamient, a document of agreement to the integration, signed by the head of administration himself. We shall waste no time in honoring Manustaat as a righteous and full Staat under the Freiestaaten union."
 fmu.5.a:0 "A toast to the new compatriots!"
 fmu.6.t:0 "FMU Seeks Alliance"
 fmu.6.d:0 "News of return of the Kaiser we're met with widespread celebration in the souther Mu nation of the FMU. A German-born colony, they were quick to unite with the crown of a united Germany. They enjoyed a prosperous relationship with us under the Associate State, but were sadly put under British rule after the Great War. Today, with Germany free of its fascist regime, and the FMU under its own libery, they seek to ally with us once more."
 fmu.6.a:0 "We welcome them with open hands."
 fmu.6.b:0 "We don't need another burden on our back."
 fmu.7.t:0 "Fascists Win Snap Elections"
 fmu.7.d:0 "In a turn of events that suprised absolutely no one, the ZNSP has won the snap elections. Organized because of increasing pressure from fascist supporters, the vote shows that the people unanimously want a stronger state. The successes of Hitler back in the Fatherland inspired many politicians to take up facism. Now, they hope to lead this nation to newfound glory, and show Mu how powerful the German race can be."
 fmu.7.a:0 "Die Deutschen Über Alles!"
 fmu.8.t:0 "[FMU.GetName] Proposes Alliance"
 fmu.8.d:0 "It seems the call for a united Germany reached farther than expected, as fascist supports had recently overthrown the government in the FMU, and now pledge loyalty to [Root.GetLeader]. They propose an alliance that would mutually benefit us both. There are doubts about the nations strategic value: it's inconviently far from Europe, and not the most developed. Nonetheless, it is hard to deny the amount of recources and manpower they are willing to put down for us."
 fmu.8.a:0 "No German left behind!"

 fmu.11.d:0 "Our military campaign in Tiquea has succeeded, and we now reap the rewards of war. Unfortunately, it is undeniable the Tiqueans won't be happy with becoming part of the FMU. Perhaps it would be wise to grant them some autonomy, to keep them from biting us."
 fmu.11.a:0 "Establish a Reichkommissariat."
 fmu.11.b:0 "We'll administer them however we damn please."
 fmu.12.t:0 "FMU Demands Subjugation."
 fmu.12.d:0 "FMU has presented us with an ultimatum: annexation or else."
 fmu.12.a:0 "A line must be drawn somewhere."
 fmu.12.b:0 "We accept."
 fmu.13.t:0 "Uprising in Manu!"
 fmu.13.d:0 "News are spreading like wildfire of the coup in the Manu Autonomous State. This morning, in an unauthorized move, members of the fascist militia have stormed the parliament, and proclaimed the nation's independence from the FMU. August Ritter's whereabouts are unknown, but it is likely he was captured by the revolutionaries. FMU representatives in the nation are putting up some resistance, but it seems the people of Manu are siding with the coup."
 fmu.13.a:0 "We are nothing compared to the will of the people."
 fmu.13.b:0 "Crush them!"
 fmu.14.t:0 "The Revolution"
 fmu.14.d:0 "Our time has come. The streets ring with cheers, as Saxonia Austral proclaims independene oncemore. After years of planning, strategic diplomacy, and gaining trust from the people, the ZZSP has made its final move, and stormed the government. Taking hold of the parliament, as well as all military assets, they have declared a complete severing of ties with the FMU, and promised a more reliable, independent, and stronger fascist government."
 fmu.14.a:0 "The Yellow Flag hangs proudly again!"
 fmu.15.t:0 "FMU Requests New Guinea"
 fmu.15.d:0 "An ambassador from the FMU arrived today with a demand from those Mu Germans. They want us to cede control of Papua and New Guinea to them, citing their previous colonial status under the German Empire. While this might seem unpleasant to contemplate, it would be better to give it to them than to the Nazis, right?"
 fmu.15.a:0 "They are right. We shall cede it immediately."
 fmu.15.b:0 "What cheeky little... No!"
 fmu.16.t:0 "The Australian Government Rejects Our Proposal"
 fmu.16.d:0 "Responding to our request to hand over the Colony of New Guinea, the Australian government has issued a stern rejection of our demands. The long statement presents a case against the validity of our claims and ability to even administer the far away island, but boils down to a simple answer: No."
 fmu.16.a:0 "You know, I never really thought this far ahead."
 fmu.17.t:0 "Australia Hands Over New Guinea."
 fmu.17.d:0 "Our recent diplomatic pressure on Australia has finally cracked them. The Colony of New Guinea is to be officially transferred to the FMU, as a client state. A german-led administration is already being put together to serve as a new government on the island, and our high command has been busy drafting war plans and funneling resources into this new Colony, hoping to establish it as a major port and jumping off point for our Navy."
 fmu.17.a:0 "Another German land back in rightful hands!"
 fmu.20.t:0 "FMU proposes Anschluss"
 fmu.20.d:0 "The ever expanding FMU doctrine has reached us too. They now stand at our doors, with an ultimatum; hand over the country!"
 fmu.20.a:0 "Never."
 fmu.20.b:0 "We're better with them!"
 fmu.20.c:0 "We'll lay down our lives for them!"
 fmu.24.t:0 "FMU Proposes Alliance"
 fmu.24.d:0 "Word has reached us the the Freiestaaten are once again attempting to establish hegemony over their slice of Mu. They've been steadily improving their military, and are pushing for solidarity between the German nations of Mu. They have reached out to us, and propose that we join them in forces."
 fmu.24.a:0 "Gladly!"
 fmu.24.b:0 "We would rather not..."
